# Use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) Tools

During the exercise, I used artificial intelligence (AI) tools such as:

- **GitHub Copilot**
  - Automation of repetitive code
  - Writing unit tests
  - Assistance in resolving compilation errors and bugs
- **Microsoft Copilot and ChatGPT**
  - Research
  - Writing documentation
  - Conducting searches

The use of AI has become increasingly common in our daily lives, simplifying tasks and significantly contributing to productivity. As a Principal Software Engineer, my goal is to encourage the team to adopt AI in an intelligent and responsible manner, always putting humans first.

It is essential that all professionals have opportunities to evolve and improve their knowledge. This way, they can validate whether the answers generated by AIs are truly relevant and correct, without taking them as absolute truths or the only source of knowledge.

We must always encourage the understanding of software engineering fundamentals, avoiding any exclusive dependence on AI.
